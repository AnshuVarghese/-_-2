# Number guessing game - task 2 of oibsip
## This repository contains source code for oibsip task 2.

### Steps to compile and execute the application.
1. Build and run the code in any Java compiler.
2. Once the system starts executing, it asks the user to enter a choice to start or end the game.
3. If the choice selected is "start", the system will generate a random number. If the choice selected is "end",
 it will exit the execution.
4. It will ask the user to enter the number of chances to guess the generated random number.
5. On entering the guesses, the system helps the user by specifying whether the number is higher or lower than the 
system generated number.
6. Based on the number of guesses, the system scores the performance of the user.
